-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The approach to give the user the option of a Dark or a Light mode was taking in consideration when developing this website. It will always start in the Dark Mode as default to be reminded of the night sky and space, in this mode there is a black background and dark grey cards. Switching to Light mode the background will be a bright pastel blue and light grey cards.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in Google ecosystem, so it is both attractive, appropriate and memorable.For the Logo the font was Orbitro that its futuristic look is similar to the fonts used in a sci-fi movie, making it very appropriated to this website, in the case of it not being supported by the browser used, Sans Serif will fallback.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The main card brings the International Space Station location in the map with a marker shaped like itself. A live streem of the Space Station will also autostart showing amazing imagery into the user's screen. Also the Astronomy Picture of the Day will catch the attention of the user with pictures of the space straight from NASA.
